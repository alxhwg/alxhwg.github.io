watches men appear and pass
some droplets of rain

a small grain of sand
briefly falls, once, within time
infinite hourglass

crafted ink on page
speaking, storing; illustrates
boundless depths of mind

Title:              A series of haikus
Summary:      Commentary is provided centered on the sun, man, and expression. The haiku is explained and clarified. Then the writer provides some self-commentary. Without much capitalization, spacing between poems/haikus, and without titles, it may be a little confusing.
Pen Name:     Heibon Uta (unless we use the same one as last week, then: Richard T. D.)
